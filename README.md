# Capturing and monitoring real-time silos data with IoT system

## Introduction

This project is an attempt to develop a system for collecting sensor data, processing and storing it, and then presenting it in a dashboard for visualization.

## installation

    - To install spark,jupiterLab and dependencies run build.sh file.
    - Run docker-compose up to install grafana and running containers.

## First use
    - open this poject https://wokwi.com/projects/351600989253403224
    - after running all the containers,proceed to this link http://localhost:8889/
    - navigate to notebooks folder and open run.ipynb,then run both cells
    - go to grafana http://localhost:3001/ and import the dashboard on dashboard folder
    - you can now start the simulation on wokwi platform and visualize data on grafana.
